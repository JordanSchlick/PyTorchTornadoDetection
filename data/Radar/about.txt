Completed: The data is available from amazon s3 https://s3.amazonaws.com/noaa-nexrad-level2/index.html
Completed: To avoid rate limits and extra requests is is probably best to cache requests for indexes of files.
Completed: All dates are in UTC. For each tornado find the nearest WSR-88d radar. 
Completed: Radars can also be down in which case data from the next closest radar should be used.
Completed: There are terminal weather radars (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Doppler_Weather_Radar) which should be excluded. Their names begin with a T.
Completed: wsr-88d radars have a range of 460 km. Any tornado not within 400km of any working radar should be excluded.
Completed: The files ending in _MDM should be excluded. I still don't know what they are, and it doesn't seem like anyone else knows either.

NEXRAD_Stations.csv contains a list of radar stations and their locations
download_radar_data.py creates the following directories
The l2data directory contains the output data for tornadic level 2 data
The s3cache directory contains cached data for s2 bucket queries and is only usefull for downloading data
The temp directory is for data while downloading and should be empty after finishing

The NEXRAD Level II archive data is hosted in the noaa-nexrad-level2 Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 AWS region. 
The address for the public bucket is: https://noaa-nexrad-level2.s3.amazonaws.com.

Naming Format of level 2 radar data:

	/<Year>/<Month>/<Day>/<NEXRAD Station/>/<filename>
	file path:
		<Year> is the year the data was collected
		<Month> is the month of the year the data was collected
		<Day> is the day of the month the data was collected
		<NEXRAD Station> is the NEXRAD ground station (map of ground stations)
		<filename> is the name of the file containing the data. These are compressed files (compressed with gzip). The file name has more precise timestamp information.
		All files in the archive use the same compressed format (.gz).
		
	GGGGYYYYMMDD_TTTTTT
	filename:
		GGGG = Ground station ID (map of ground stations)
		YYYY = year
		MM = month
		DD = day
		TTTTTT = time when data started to be collected (GMT)
		Note that the 2015 files have an additional field on the file name. It adds “_V06” to the end of the file name. An example is KABX20150303_001050_V06.gz.
