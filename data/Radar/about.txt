The data is available from amazon s3 https://s3.amazonaws.com/noaa-nexrad-level2/index.html
To avoid rate limits and extra requests is is probably best to cache requests for indexes of files.
All dates are in UTC. For each tornado find the nearest WSR-88d radar. 
Radars can also be down in which case data from the next closest radar should be used.
There are terminal weather radars (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Doppler_Weather_Radar) which should be excluded. Their names begin with a T.
wsr-88d radars have a range of 460 km. Any tornado not within 400km of any working radar should be excluded.
The files ending in _MDM should be excluded. I still don't know what they are, and it doesn't seem like anyone else knows either.
