Completed: The data is available from amazon s3 https://s3.amazonaws.com/noaa-nexrad-level2/index.html
Completed: To avoid rate limits and extra requests is is probably best to cache requests for indexes of files.
Completed: All dates are in UTC. For each tornado find the nearest WSR-88d radar. 
Completed: Radars can also be down in which case data from the next closest radar should be used.
Completed: There are terminal weather radars (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Doppler_Weather_Radar) which should be excluded. Their names begin with a T.
Completed: wsr-88d radars have a range of 460 km. Any tornado not within 400km of any working radar should be excluded.
Completed: The files ending in _MDM should be excluded. I still don't know what they are, and it doesn't seem like anyone else knows either.

NEXRAD_Stations.csv contains a list of radar stations and their locations
download_radar_data.py creates the following directories
